        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Food waste is a fairly large issue in this country, as well as food insecurity. The point of this project
           is to merge the two problems to mitigate them. The business is a matchmaking service, on one end there are
           sellers, those who are about to have expired food, such as a grocery stores, farmers, and restaurants that 
           could not sell their full stock, or have leftovers that cannot be finished. The other half of it is buyers, average people, or street vendors who would like food immediately for a discounted price. 
        </p>
        <h3>Statistics</h3>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition/en/">United Nations Food and Agriculture
                Organization</a> (FAO) estimates that about 815 million people of the
            7.6 billion people in the world, or 10.7%, were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2016. Almost all
            the hungry people live in lower-middle-income countries. There are 11 million people undernourished in
            developed
            countries (FAO 2015; for individual country estimates, see Annex 1. For other valuable sources, especially
            if
            interested in particular countries or regions, see IFPRI <a
                href="http://www.ifpri.org/topic/global-hunger-index">2016</a> and Rosen et. al. 2016).</p>
        <h3>What is being done</h3>
        <p>We can only tackle world hunger effectively if we address what causes it in the first place. This means
            improving systems and behaviors that enable secure access, availability and use of food. After decades
            of underinvestment, countries like the U.S. have begun to reinvest in programs to fight global hunger.
            The effort has built momentum over the years, culminating in 2015 when the global community came
            together to commit to pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, with ending hunger as a top priority.</p>
