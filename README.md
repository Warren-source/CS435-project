you'll need python, flask, flask-login, and sqlalchemy to run this

terminal commands to download what you need:
pip3 install flask
pip3 install flask-login
pip3 install flask-sqlalchemy

python must be downloaded from its website

to run this, cd into project folder and type:
python3 main.py

I learned a lot on how to build websites from this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI&t=1s

just letting you know that this tutorial serves as the foundation where I built this site,
though it is far more complex and involves many different tools
than what is built in the tutorial.
