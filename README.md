--note from Warren--
I learned a lot on how to build websites from this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI&t=1s

Just letting you know that this tutorial taught me most of the tools I used to built this site,
though it is far more complex and involves many different tools than what is built in the tutorial.
